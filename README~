We provide the libraries compiled in a machine with ubuntu 64-bits and some include files.

if you already instaled and compiled root for your machine the only thing you have to do is set the variable "ROOT_INSTALL" to the direction of instalation.
in the CMakeLists.txt, in order to run the program you need to add the bash variable
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="direction_of_installation_of_root/lib":
